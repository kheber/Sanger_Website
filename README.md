# Sanger Analysis Website

This repository serves to track source code changes to an accessible Sanger Sequencing analysis website. As of writing, the website is available to those with a Penn State account who are using the psu wifi network or the Global Protect VPN (but not both!).

The website is provisionally being hosted at the following URL: http://bisanzlab.science.psu.edu:3838/SangerAnalysisR/

**WARNING**
This current version has a bug wherin multiple people using the website will be able to access other user's sanger traces. It is unclear if this is an issue with the source code or configuration of hosting the website. Future versions will seek to address this critical bug.
